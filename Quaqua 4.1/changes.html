  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>

  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Enhancements</p>

  <h3>Version 3.9.2<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-08-09</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Enhancements</p>
  <ul>
      <li>QuaquaTextFieldUI, QuaquaPasswordFieldUI, QuaquaFormattedTextFieldUI:
      Added a new client property "Quaqua.TextComponent.autoSelect"</li>
      <li>UIManager: Added a new property "TextComponent.autoSelect"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul>
      <li>QuaquaHighlighter: Must use inactive selection background, when
      the text component has a selection, but is not on an active window.</li>
      <li>QuaquaUtilities: Method isFocused() did not properly
  determine the focused state of a JComponent, when the user
  clicked on another JFrame or another JDialog.</li>
      <li>QuaquaListUI, QuaquaTableUI, QuaquaTreeUI: Don't change the selection of an already
      selected item, when the mouse click is a popup trigger.</li>
      <li>QuaquaTreeUI: Support multiple selection by mouse dragging.
        By default, the invokesStopCellEditing property of a JTree is set to true.</li>
      <li>BasicQuaquaLookAndFeel: Look and feel decorated title bar did not render properly.</li>
      <li>RootPaneUI: Only snap to the edge of another window, if the window
          is within close distance. Don't snap, if the use holds the alt key down, while dragging a window.</li>
      <li>QuaquaTextFieldUI, QuaquaPasswordFieldUI, QuaquaFormattedTextFieldUI:
      Transferring the focus to one of these components using the Tabulator key
      automatically selects all text on the component.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.9.1<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-07-31</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul>
      <li>QuaquaComboBoxUI: Removed debugging output. UIManager property
  "ComboBox.harmonizePreferredHeight" had no effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.9<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-07-30</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Enhancements</p>
  <ul>
      <li>JBrowser: Added support for KeyListener to API. This allows to listen for key
        events which occur on the currently focused column.</li>
      <li>ComboBoxUI: Added UIManager property &quot;ComboBox.harmonizePreferredHeight&quot;. Setting this to true causes editable and non-editable combo boxes to have the
        same preferred height, resulting in better layouts with some layout managers.</li>
      <li>TextFieldUI: Added client property &quot;Quaqua.TextField.style&quot; with the values &quot;plain&quot;
        and &quot;search&quot;. Set this property to &quot;search&quot; to get a text field with
        rounded corners like
        the
        Spotlight
        search field.</li>
      <li>RootPaneUI: Added UIManager property &quot;RootPane.windowSnapDistance&quot;. Setting this
        to an Integer value greater than 0 causes windows to snap to the edges
        of each other and to the screen bounds. This property is only in effect
        for look and feel decorated windows.</li>
      <li>LayoutStyle: Added support for Java 1.6 javax.swing.LayoutStyle API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul><li>FileChooserUI: File chooser ran into an inconsistent state, when
the JFileChooser was constructed with a different directory than the users
home directory.</li>
    <li>MenuUI: Listeners were not properly installed, due to this, accelerators did
    not work always.</li>
    <li>OptionPaneUI: The application icon was not scaled properly, when 
    Quaqua ran without native code.</li>
    <li>RootPaneUI: Resize icon wasn't drawn for look and feel decorated
JDialog windows; Look and feel decorated windows couldn't always be dragged from
      a secondary screen to the main screen.</li>
    <li>TextFieldUI, FormattedTextFieldUI, PasswordFieldUI: Added two pixels to
    preferred width.</li>
    <li>All text component UI's:Fixed input map for backspace key (replaced "typed \010" by "BACK_SPACE").</li>
    <li>quaqua-filechooser-only.jar, quaqua-menu-only.jar, 
    quaqua-colorchooser-only.jar: Added missing QuaquaLookAndFeel class.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.8.1<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-06-18</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul>
    <li>QuaquaFileChooserUI: Aliases in the sidebar were resolved with user interaction before the user 
      clicked on them, causing remote volumes to be mounted too early.</li>
    <li>QuaquaColorChooserUI: The color picker threw an exception when it was moved to a secondary screen. The color picker now degrades its functionality when it is moved on a secondary screen.</li>
    <li>QuaquaOptionPaneUI: The OK button sometimes had no text.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.8<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-05-26</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Enhancements</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental Swedish resource file added. The resource file is mostly
      in English, only some texts for the JFileChooser and the JOption pane have
      been translated
      into Swedish.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul>
    <li>QuaquaFileChooserUI: Aliases were resolved with user interaction before the user 
    clicked on them, causing remote volumes to be mounted too early. Aliases
       to folders didn't behave like regular folders.</li>
     <li>QuaquaFileChooserUI PreviewPane: File icons render now properly, when
    Quartz is turned off. The file kind is now retrieved from the Finder.</li>
     <li>QuaquaIconFactory: The application icon is now rendered properly, when
    Quartz is turned off.</li>
    <li>Quaqua14RootPaneUI: Repaints 200 milliseconds after a resize to 
    workaround 'double striking' of components. If someone nows how to actually
    fix this problem - let me know!</li>
 </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.7.7<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-04-16</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Fixes</p>

  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.7.6<br />

    <li>QuaquaTextFieldBorder takes margin of JTextComponent into account.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 3.7.5<br />
    <font size="-1">2007-04-11</font></h3>
  <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Enhancements</p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">To resolve issues with selection colors: Added client
        property <code>Quaqua.Component.cellRendererFor</code>.
        This can be set on a component that is used as a cell renderer. The value
        is the component that holds the cells, for example a JTable, a JTree
        or a JList.</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1">FileChooserUI: Double clicking the file preview approves
        now the current selection.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixes</p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">Removed  unnecessary console output.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Version 3.7.4<br />
          <font size="-1">2007-02-24</font></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ColorChooserUI: The text in the text fields is now selected, when
            the text fields gain focus.</li>
          <li>ButtonUI: The UIManager property <code>Button.defaultButtonFollowsFocus</code>            is
            now supported on all J2SE versions (not just in J2SE 5 and later
            versions). The default value for this property is <code>false</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ColorChooserUI: Due to rounding errors, some colors, such as RGB
            0,170,0 were changed to other values when the color chooser was opened;
            The text fields were too short for J2SE 1.3; The text fields in the
            HTMLChooser were updated with integer values instead of with Hex
            values.</li>
          <li>OptionPaneUI: Sometimes, when creating the icons for a JOptionPane
            the following was output on the console, and the application froze:
            &quot;Please Attach Debugger: No Autorelease pool exists. 
            Press any key to continue&#8230;&quot;.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 3.7.3<br />

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OptionPaneUI: The UIManager property &quot;OptionPane.messageLabelWidth&quot; can
            be set to 0, to prevent Quaqua from enforcing the width of HTML messages
            displayed in option panes. The UIManager property &quot;OptionPane.maxCharacterPerLineCount&quot;
            has now been added, it can be used to use a smaller value than returned
            by JOptionPane.getMaxCharacterPerLineCount().</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ComboBoxUI: Combo box editor had the wrong background color.</li>
          <li>PopupMenuUI: Mouse released events were just closing the popup
            menu without performing menu actions.</li>
          <li>ColorChooserUI: The color chooser did not work in security restricted
            Java web-start applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 3.7.2<br />
          <font size="-1">2007-02-10</font></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>FileChooserUI: Improved  performance of file sorting.</li>
          <li>PopupMenuUI: When Quaqua
            is run in a security restricted environment, it turns off the fix
            for the mouse release behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 3.7.1<br />

          <li>PopupMenuUI: Menu items on a heavyweight popup invoke their actions
            now on mouse release</li>
          <li>TabbedPaneUI: Fixed keyboard navigation when
            vertical tab runs are shown on the left or on the right. Panther
            style tabbed panes were not always rendered with antialasing.</li>
          <li>TableUI:
              Did only repaint the lead selection cell instead of all selected
          cells when focus changed.</li>
          <li>Text components: Added client property <code>Quaqua.TextComponent.showPopup</code>            that allows to disable the popup menu created by the Quaqua look
            and feel.</li>
          <li>When run with Java 5 or higher, opaqueness is changed
            using LookAndFeel.installProperty instead of setting it directly.</li>
          <li>Fixed RequestFocusEnabled for some components.</li>
          <li>JSheet sometimes couldn't get focus.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>FileChooserUI: Displays a warning dialog when the user attempts
            to save to a file that already exists. Does not support  Unix
            wildcards in the filename text field anymore. Improves performance
            on slow network volumes, such as WebDAV folders.</li>

          <li>TabbedPaneUI: Replaces Apple's TabbedPaneUI for Panther. The new
            Panther TabbedPaneUI squeezes tabs and eventually collapses them

          <li>The windowModified client property works now on JRootPane's.</li>
          <li>Renamed variables which had the name &quot;enum&quot; to avoid
            conflicts with the Java 1.5 programming language specification.</li>
          <li>Fixed choice pattern exception in Italian locale of FileChooserUI.</li>
          <li>Entering a color in the HTML field in the ColorChooserUI did not
            update the sliders.</li>
          <li>Controls were not updating their state on window deactivation/activation
            when running with Java 1.5.</li>
          <li>Quaqua is not using ProxyLazyValue for QuaquaMenuBorder anymore
            when running with Java 1.3.</li>
          <li>Fixed ComboBoxUI popup insets when used as a non-editable TableCellRenderer
            with Java 1.3.</li>
          <li>Fixed FileChooserUI insets for labels in preview panel when running
            with Java 1.3.</li>
          <li>Fixed broken FileChooser-only versions of Quaqua.</li>
          <li>Quaqua is now setting dummy-insets in the UIManager for insets
            that change their size dynamically. Prior 3.0 beta versions set these
            insets to null which caused some JVM's to crash.</li>
          <li>Vertically aligned labels and values in the preview column of the
            FileChooserUI.</li>
          <li>Borders return now always a clone of their insets.</li>
          <li>ComboBoxButtonUI does not draw with bad insets, if the look and
            feel is changed after the JComboBox has been created. </li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.8 - 2.8.3<br />
          <font size="-1">2005-01-30 - 2005-03-21</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Panther design: JFileChooser's renders color labels. This feature
            requires the presence of libquaqua.jnilib in the library path.</li>
          <li>Panther design: JFileChooser's show a preview column for files,
            when used as an open dialog. This feature is localized for English,
            German, French and Italian only. The preview column is not shown
            for other languages.</li>
          <li>All designs: The sorting order of Files in JFileChooser's matches
            now much better the sorting oder of native file dialogs.</li>
          <li>All designs: File names in JFileChooser's are abbreviated in the
            middle (instead of at the end).</li>
          <li>Added missing binding for TAB key
              in multiline text fields.</li>
          <li>Added missing files to quaqua-filechooser.jar.</li>
          <li>Panther file chooser did not work with Java 1.3 due to missing
            Locale, when JFileChooser has no parent.</li>
          <li>Panther file chooser did not properly display file preview with
            Java 1.3.</li>
          <li>Setting illegal file paths with non-existent path elements could
            cause IllegalStateException when opening a JFileChooser.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apple's MRJ for Java 1.4.1 throws a class cast exception when Quaqua
            tries to draw an image bevel border using a compatible buffered image.
            To work around this, Quaqua uses now a standard ARGB image when running
            on this JVM.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.7<br />
          <font size="-1">2005-01-06</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All Quaqua UI's that are in use for Java 1.4 are now used for Java
            1.3 as well. This results in many improvements when running Java
            1.3.</li>
          <li>Panther design: Selected items in list, tables and trees are now
            shown with white text on a darker version of the selection color.
            This matches much better the Panther design than before.</li>
          <li>Quaqua uses now its own MenuUI and MenuBarUI, if the screen menu
            bar is switched off.</li>
          <li>Panther design: Quaqua uses now a round check icon on RadioButtonMenuItems
            instead of a diamond check icon.</li>
          <li>Java 1.3 version: user interface elements on inactive windows are
            now rendered with inactive appearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quaqua closes now the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist
            after it has read it.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.6<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-12-22</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mouse popup triggers (Ctrl+Click) does not change the selection
            of a JTable, JList or JTree.</li>
          <li>Quaqua uses now the color gray consistently for focus borders in
            JTable's, JList's and JTree's.</li>
          <li>Setting the client property &quot;Quaqua.List.style&quot; to &quot;striped&quot; on
            a JList renders the list with altnernating row colors. This feature
            is only available when the JList has a vertical layout orientation.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.5<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-12-05</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved keyboard behaviour of JTextField, JTextArea and JComboBox.
            Cursor up moves to the beginning of the text if the cursor is on
            the first line. Cursor down moves to the end of the text if the cursor
            is on the last line. Alt+Del deletes to the end of the word or the
            next word. Alt+Backspace deletes to the beginning of the word or
            the previous word. (Improvements apply to Java 1.4 only).</li>
          <li>Changed icon of CheckBoxMenuItem to match Panther design (Java
            1.4 only).</li>
          <li>JFileChooser's use the last modification time of a directory to
            decide wether its contents needs to be read again. This should greatly
            reduce I/O when a file chooser is reused, or when a user browses
            the same directory multiple times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added missing classes to quaqua-filechooser.jar to fix ClassNotFoundException.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.4<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-11-05</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The user items section of the sidebar of the QuaquaPantherFileChooserUI
            shows now the same user items as the Finder.<br />
    (This works only, if the JNI code of Quaqua is in the library path).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vertical scrollbar in sidebar of the QuaquaPantherFileChooserUI
            did never appear, even when there was not enough space in the sidebar
            to display all items.</li>
          <li>Sidebar of the QuaquaPantherFileChooserUI erroneously suported
            multiple selection of items instead of single selection.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Versions 2.3 - 2.3.1<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-11-02</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dropping a file on a JFileChooser selects the file.</li>
          <li>The computer is now shown as the root of the file system in the
            folder combo box of JFileChooser's. In previous versions, the system
            volume was shown as the root. This fix works only on Mac OS X 10.3
            or later.</li>
          <li>Renamed file libQuaquaFiles.jnilib to libquaqua.jnilib.</li>
          <li>Selecting
              an item in the sidebar or in the location combo box using a QuaquaPantherFileChooserUI
            did not always work.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.2<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-10-26</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The release contains now a new file quaqua-filechooser.jar which
            contains only the Look and Feel classes for the Panther FileChooser
            UI. This is for use in applets or applications that have size restrictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calling setFileSelected on a JFileChooser did not work properly,
            when the provided File object had a relative path.</li>
          <li>When a file is selected, the open button was made enabled, but
            not made the default button (blue flashing).</li>
          <li>Double clicking a JFileChooser did not approve the current file
            selection.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.1<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-10-17</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The FileChooserUI's resolve now aliases to files and directories.</li>
          <li>Determining the name of the system volume in class PantherFileSystemView
            now uses fallback code, if method File.getCanonicalFile() on a volume
            fails. In prior versions this caused an InternalError, when attempting
            to open JFileChooser.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The file name text field in a save file JFileChooser dialog keeps
            now its contents, when another directory is selected.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>Versions 2.0beta - 2.0.2<br />
  <font size="-1">2004-07-29 - 2004-10-06</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cleaned up the number of look and feel classes.</li>
          <li>FileChooserUI with Panther design added.</li>
          <li>QuaquaFileChooserUI label of approve button changes to &quot;Choose&quot;,
            when the file chooser is used to choose a directory.</li>
          <li>Added missing keyboard bindings for QuaquaComboBoxUI.</li>
          <li>Added functionality to make Quaqua Look and Feel work in a Java
            1.3 Applet sandbox.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bugs in FileChooserUI with Jaguar design.</li>
          <li>Fixed an IndexOutOfBoundsException
            in QuaquaFileChooserUI which caused a file chooser to become unresponsive.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug which caused some JComponents on a java.awt.Window
            to always draw in inactive state.</li>
          <li>The popup of the ComboBoxUI extends
              its width to accomodate the widest item in the list.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 1.8<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-06-26</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>TableUI with support for striped style added.</li>
          <li>Jaguar design for TabbedPaneUI can be switched off.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bugs in FileChooserUI.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 1.7<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-05-02</font></h3>
        <p>Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>QuaquaComboBoxUI added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>FileChooserUI creates folders now at the correct location.</li>
          <li>MenuUI has now corrected popup offsets.</li>
          <li>When running Java 1.4 or higher, QuaquaComboBoxUI and QuaquaTabbedPaneUI
            render in click-through state, when their parent Window is not focus
            owner.</li>
        </ul>
  <h3>Version 1.6 - 1.6.2<br />
          <font size="-1">2004-03-14 through 2004-03-30</font></h3>
        <p class="semiparagraph">Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>File names are displayed in gray, when the JFileChooser is in FILE_SAVE
            mode.</li>
          <li>System property 'Quaqua.FileChooser.autovalidate' added. </li>
          <li>When clicking on a file on a JFileChooser in FILE_SAVE mode, the
            file name is now transferred into the filename text field. Thus the
            JFileChooser behaves now like a native file dialog for Mac OS X 10.3
            (Panther). The look of the JFileChooser is still the one of Mac OS
            X 10.2 (Jaguar).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reimplemented the update strategy for the FileSystemTreeModel.
            A directory is now updated only when the user clicks at it. Prior
            to this version, the whole path up to a file was refreshed frequently.
            This resulted in an unacceptable amount of I/O operations for directories
            located on remote computers.</li>
          <li>Class OSXFileView catches NullPointerException's thrown by AquaFileView,
            when trying to determine isTraversable on aliases if the the alias
            is to a network volume that is no longer mounted.</li>
          <li>Fixed an IndexedOutOfBoundsException which occured when a 'default'
            file name was supplied to a JFileChooser in FILE_SAVE mode, and the
            user aborted the JFileChooser.</li>
          <li>OSXFileView throws a NullPointerException when method getName(File)
            is called with a null argument. This prevents the JVM from crashing
            in native code in the AquaFileView.</li>
          <li>Reduced the size of quaqua.jar. Some image files in quaqua.jar
            were unnecessarily big. The classes are now compiled without debugging
            information.</li>
  </ul>
        <h3>Versions 1.5 - 1.5.1<br />
    <font size="-1">2004-02-07 through 2004-02-15</font>
    </h3>
        <p class="semiparagraph">Enhancements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support for Java 1.4.2 added.</li>
          <li>Improved the performance of the FileSystemTreeModel and the OSXFileView.
            This significantly reduces the slugginess of the QuaquaFileChooserUI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a sporadicaly occuring null pointer exception in the QuaquaFileChooserUI.</li>
          <li>Fixed more sporadicaly occuring null pointer exceptions in the
            QuaquaFileChooserUI which were caused by class JBrowser using method
            JComponent.getLocationOnScreen() to determine the mouse location.</li>

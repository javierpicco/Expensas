 * @author  Werner Randelshofer
 * @version 2.0 2005-07-14 Added operation getBaseline. 
 * Replaced operation getVisualBounds by operation getVisualMargin.
 * <br>1.2 2005-06-15 Removed support for both LOWERCASE_TEXT_BOUNDS
 * and UPPERCASE_TEXT_BOUNDS. There is no only support for TEXT_BOUNDS, which
 * is equivalent to UPPERCASE_TEXT_BOUNDS.
 * <br>1.1 2005-06-11 Lowercase text bounds are now based on the height of character 
 * 'x' instead of character 'z'. This is because 'X-Height' is a common
 * typographic scale for the ascent of lower case character.
 * <br>1.0  2005-05-12  Created.
